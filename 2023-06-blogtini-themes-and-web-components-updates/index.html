Working with the amazing
[Renior, another volunteer](https://twitter.com/renoirb) ... We've been splitting up the main (javascript) post "crawling" and processing, from the formatting.

## Themes
That gives us very easy to create themes!  A theme can reuse formating or "business logic" from other themes -- or come up with any number of new ways to display pages and/or the entire site.

The above image shows the theme picker from the top nav menu.

## Web Components
We settled on
[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
which are browser native (as opposed to `react`).

Tracey likes [lit](https://lit.dev/) since it is a lightweight/minimal setup atop
native web components.  But a theme can use any style of web components they like.

## Example
Once the posts are all parsed from your site, they are stored in a browser cache (`localStorage` or `indexedDB`).

When you arrive at a blog post, a page, or a list of posts for a given tag, etc.
the main javascript can simply rewrite the page `<body>` tag to:

```html
<bt-body>
  <bt-posts>
    <bt-post url="first-post-with-tag/"></bt-post>
    <bt-post url="second-post-with-tag/"></bt-post>
    ...
  </bt-posts>
</bt-body>
```

Each web component is its own javacript file that knows how to render the given section.

For example, this is the default theme's
[bt-post](https://blogtini.com/theme/future-imperfect/bt-post.js)
file/component.

Here is a [second theme](https://blogtini.com/theme/grid/index.js) and how it sets itself up --
as overrides to the main theme.
